    "# Q1. How does bagging reduce overfitting in decision trees?\n",
    "# Bagging, or bootstrap aggregation, is a technique that can reduce overfitting in decision trees by introducing randomness into the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In bagging, multiple samples are drawn with replacement from the original training dataset to create new subsets of data, which are used to train multiple decision tree models.\n",
    "# Each of these decision tree models is trained on a different subset of the data and may have slightly different splits and rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When making a prediction on a new data point, each of the decision tree models makes its own prediction, and the final prediction is obtained by aggregating the predictions of all the models (e.g., by taking the average).\n",
    "# This aggregation process helps to reduce the variance in the predictions, which can reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bagging also reduces overfitting by reducing the impact of individual outliers or noise in the data, as these points are less likely to appear in every bootstrap sample. \n",
    "# By averaging across many decision trees, the overall prediction becomes more stable and less sensitive to noise or outliers in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overall, bagging can be an effective technique for reducing overfitting in decision trees, and it is often used in ensemble methods such as random forests."
