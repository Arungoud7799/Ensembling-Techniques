    "\n",
    "# An ensemble technique in machine learning refers to a method of combining multiple models to improve the accuracy and robustness of the predictions made by the models.\n",
    "# This is achieved by training several models on the same dataset, but with different variations in the model architecture, training data, or hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ensemble techniques can be broadly classified into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bagging: This technique involves training multiple models independently on different subsets of the training data,\n",
    "# and then combining their predictions by taking the average or majority vote.\n",
    "# Examples of bagging techniques include random forests and bootstrap aggregating (or bagging).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Boosting: This technique involves training multiple weak models sequentially, with each model focusing on the examples that the previous models found difficult to classify correctly.\n",
    "# The predictions of these weak models are then combined to produce a final prediction. Examples of boosting techniques include AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.\n",

    "# Ensemble techniques are used in machine learning for a variety of reasons, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Improved accuracy: Ensemble techniques can often achieve higher accuracy than single models, particularly when the dataset is noisy or complex. This is because ensembles are able to capture more diverse patterns in the data and make more robust predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reduced overfitting: Ensemble techniques can also help to reduce overfitting, which occurs when a model is too complex and starts to memorize the training data instead of learning generalizable patterns. Ensembles can achieve this by combining multiple models that have been trained on different subsets of the data or with different hyperparameters, which reduces the risk of any one model overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Robustness: Ensemble techniques can also improve the robustness of a model, which refers to its ability to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. By combining multiple models that have been trained on different variations of the data, ensembles are better able to generalize to new examples and adapt to changes in the data distribution.\n",

Bagging is primarily used for reducing the variance of a model and preventing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In bagging, the training dataset is randomly sampled with replacement to create multiple subsets of data, which are then used to train individual models. Because each subset contains some random variation, the models will each have slightly different parameters and will make slightly different predictions. When making a prediction on new data, bagging combines the predictions of all the individual models by averaging or taking the majority vote.\n",

    "# One of the main advantages of bagging is that it can help to reduce overfitting, which occurs when a model is too complex and memorizes the training data instead of learning generalizable patterns.

During training, each example in the dataset is assigned a weight that reflects its difficulty, and the weights are adjusted after each model is trained to give more emphasis to the misclassified examples. When making a prediction on new data, boosting combines the predictions of all the individual models by weighted averaging, with more weight given to the models that perform well on the difficult examples.\n",
